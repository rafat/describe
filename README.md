# DeScribe

A Science and Research focused Group Blogging Platform that allows any post to be minted as a Coin on Base Sepolia Testnet using Zora protocol Coins SDK. The aim is not just to enable bloggers to be rewarded with a sizeable supply of the coin, it is also to enable creators to build a community of readers by letting them reward the community for commenting and for sharing these posts. More on this below.

## DEMO

The project is live on netlify at https://playful-gecko-9fae0a.netlify.app/

You will need some Base Sepolia Tokens if you want to interact with the Zora coin contracts.

## Getting Started Locally

The project is build on Next.Js 15+.

```bash

git clone https://github.com/rafat/describe.git
cd describe
npm install
npm run dev
```

You'll also have to rename .example to .env and add your keys.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
